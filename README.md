console-log-viewer.js
==================

## .. displays logs and Javascript errors in an overlay on top of your site. Useful for mobile webdevelopment. Installed in 5 seconds [1]. Works on every device and browser [2].

#### It's useful when you want to see logs and the errors you [3] have created in a mobile browser while you are developing and debugging. 

> I found debugging is a bit hard on mobile devices since there is no magic button in mobile browser to see the console logs or Javascript errors and related source. There are a lot of remote-tools. Some are not available for all browsers, take time too much time to setup or aren't sync because of remote delays. 

## How to install (in 5 seconds)?

Add this piece of code somewhere in your html-page. Save document, refresh browser.  
In the `<head>` before other `<script>` tags is probably the best place.
    
```html
<script src="https://markknol.github.io/console-log-viewer/console-log-viewer.js"></script>
```

## What does it do?

It captures `console.log`, `console.info`, `console.warn`, `console.debug`, `console.error` and `window.onerror` and displays it in an overlay on top of your site. That's it.
